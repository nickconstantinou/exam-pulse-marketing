> Here's what actually happens to your brain 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
> Students who sleep < 6 hours before an exam?
> 
> They score 30% WORSE than those who sleep 8 hours.
> 
> Even if the 6-hour group studied more.

**Tweet 3:**
> Sleep isn't passive.
> 
> Your brain is WORKING:
> 
> 🧠 Moving memories to long-term
> 🧠 Clearing metabolic waste
> 🧠 Trimming weak connections

**Tweet 4:**
> Two types of memory:
> 
> 📝 Facts (dates, terms): Consolidates in 1 night
> 🧮 Problem-solving (maths, essays): Takes 3 DAYS
> 
> Start complex subjects early.

**Tweet 5:**
> All-nighter effects:
> 
> ❌ Working memory drops 25%
> ❌ Reaction time = legally drunk
> ❌ Anxiety becomes overwhelming
> ❌ Creativity vanishes

**Tweet 6:**
> Night before exam:
> 
> ✅ Light review (1-2 hours max)
> ✅ Sleep by 10 PM
> ✅ Wake up early for quick recap
> 
> ❌ NOT: "One more topic"

**Tweet 7:**

## 💼 LINKEDIN POST

> Every year, students pull all-nighters before exams.
> 
> Every year, they perform worse than if they'd just slept.
> 
> The data is brutal:
> 
> Students sleeping less than 6 hours score 30% worse than those sleeping 8 hours — even when the sleep-deprived group studied more.
> 
> Here's why:
> 
> Sleep isn't passive. Your brain is consolidating memories, clearing toxins, and strengthening neural pathways.
> 
> An all-nighter skips all of that.
> 
> Complex problem-solving (maths, languages, essays) takes 72 hours to fully consolidate. Start three days early.
> 
> The night before? Light review. Early sleep. Morning recap.
> 
> That's it.
> 
> Sleep is your secret weapon.
