> Everyone swears by the Pomodoro Technique.
> 
> 25 minutes of work. 5 minute break. Repeat.
> 
> But here's what most people miss:
> 
> Your brain has natural 90-minute energy cycles.
> 
> After 50 minutes of focus? Retention drops 10-15%.
> 
> So yes, Pomodoro works — but only if you:
> 
> 1. Track your Pomodoros (otherwise it's theatre)
> 2. Actually take real breaks (Instagram doesn't count)
> 3. Match the timer to the subject (45 min for maths, 25 min for languages)
> 
> It's not magic. It's structure.
> 
> And structure is what most students need.
