2. **The Sprinter** (16, GCSE): Lazy but smart. Wants maximum grades for minimum effort
3. **The Strategist** (15, GCSE): Gamifier. Loves leaderboards, streaks
4. **The Overwhelmed** (18, A-Level): High anxiety. Easily discouraged by "red" visuals
5. **The Habit-Builder** (14, GCSE): Needs routine. Follows instructions literally

### 🧪 The Stress-Test Panel (The Breakers)
6. **The Dopamine Chaser** (16, ADHD): Needs instant feedback. Will close app if bored
7. **The Loophole Hunter** (15): Cares about looking busy, not learning
8. **The Low-Data Commuter** (17): Old phone, bad 4G, needs fast load

### 🏛️ The Stakeholder Panel (The Buyers)
9. **The Hands-Off Investor** (Parent): Wants peace of mind, green dashboards
10. **The High-Pressure Coach** (Parent): Wants elite results, data proof
11. **The Data-Driven Mentor** (Teacher): Wants class-wide insights
12. **The Tech-Skeptic** (Teacher): Cares about syllabus (AQA/OCR) alignment

## How to Run a Review

### Step 1: Prepare the Asset
- Summarize the landing page/copy/feature in 200 words
- Include the CTA and key messaging
- Note target audience (age, exam board context)

### Step 2: Run Through Each Persona
For each persona, answer:
- **Reaction:** 1-sentence gut check in their voice
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail / Friction
- **Feedback:** One actionable critique

### Step 3: Synthesize
Create an Executive Summary:
- **Conflict Map:** Where do personas disagree?
- **Vulnerability Report:** Accessibility, Integrity, Technical risks
- **Actionable Roadmap:** Quick Win, Retention Hook, Cheque-Writer Feature

## Review Triggers
Use this skill when:
- Launching new landing pages
- Testing ad copy
