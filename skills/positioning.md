# Positioning Architect for ExamPulse

## Objective
Find the angle that makes ExamPulse the only logical choice for GCSE students and parents.

## The 4 U's Framework
Every angle must hit at least 3:
* **Urgent:** Why now? (Exam pressure is intensifying)
* **Unique:** Why ExamPulse? (Adaptive AI that learns YOUR gaps)
* **Useful:** Clear benefit (Stop wasting time on topics you already know)
* **Ultra-Specific:** Who is it for? (GCSE students, stressed parents)

## Advanced Angles for EdTech

### The "Mechanism" Angle
"Everyone uses past papers, but they don't adapt to what you actually need. ExamPulse uses AI to find YOUR gaps."

### The "Enemy" Angle
"It's not your fault ChatGPT gives you fake answers. Get real exam prep that actually works."

### The "Parent" Angle
"Stop guessing what your child needs. Let AI pinpoint exactly where their grades are being held back."

## Market Positioning for ExamPulse

### Primary Angle (for landing page)
"Stop Cramming. Start Understanding."

### The Antagonist
- Generic revision apps (one-size-fits-all)
- ChatGPT (confident wrong answers)
- Past papers (inefficient, no adaptation)
- Tutoring (expensive, hard to access)

### Target Audience
- GCSE students (14-16)
- Parents of GCSE students
- Budget-conscious but value education
