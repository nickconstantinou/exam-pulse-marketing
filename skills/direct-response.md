# Direct Response Copy - ExamPulse Edition

## Goal
Get the click. Get the sign-up. No fluff.

## Key Frameworks

### PAS (Problem - Agitation - Solution)
1. **Problem:** "You've been revising for hours but your grades aren't moving."
2. **Agitation:** "Everyone else is wasting time on topics they already know. You're playing guess-what-the-examiner-wants."
3. **Solution:** "ExamPulse finds YOUR gaps and tailors every question to you."

### AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)
1. **Attention:** "Your revision is broken."
2. **Interest:** "AI that knows exactly what you don't know."
3. **Desire:** "Stop guessing. Start improving."
4. **Action:** "Try free. No catch."

## ExamPulse-Specific Formulas

### Headline Options
- "Stop Cramming. Start Understanding."
- "Your Revision Is Inefficient. AI Knows Why."
- "GCSE Prep That Adapts to You."

### CTA Buttons
- ✅ "Try Free" (not "Get Started")
- ✅ "Find My Gaps" (not "Start Learning")
- ✅ "Yes, I Want Better Grades" (first person)

### Social Proof
- "Used by [X] students"
- "Based on [X] past papers"
- "AI that actually understands exams"

## Constraints
- Every sentence must earn its place
- Talk to ONE person: "You" not "students"
- The "So What?" test: if weak, rewrite

## Formatting
- **Bold** key benefits (scanners read bold first)
- Use > blockquotes for testimonials
- CTAs in first person
