# Social Assets Skill

## What I Can Do

### 1. Generate Hooks & Scripts
Research and write viral TikTok/Reels hooks:
- Problem-based hooks ("You're revising wrong")
- Comparison hooks ("ChatGPT vs ExamPulse")
- Quiz hooks ("What's YOUR revision type?")
- Revelation hooks ("Wait, AI can do this?")

### 2. Create Image Templates
Build HTML templates that can be screenshotted for:
- Instagram Stories (1080x1920)
- Instagram Posts (1080x1080)
- Twitter/X posts (1200x675)
- LinkedIn (1200x627)

### 3. Video Script Framework
Structure for 15-60 second videos:
- Hook (0-3 sec): Stop the scroll
- Value (3-15 sec): The insight
- CTA (15-30 sec): The ask

## Current Top Hooks for EdTech

### Problem Hooks
- "Your revision is inefficient. AI knows why."
- "ChatGPT is lying to you about exam answers."
- "Stop cramming. Start understanding."

### Quiz Hooks
- "What's YOUR revision type? Take the quiz."
- "Find your gaps in 5 questions."

### Comparison Hooks
- "ChatGPT vs Quizlet vs [Your Product]"
- "Why generic AI doesn't work for exams"

### Revelation Hooks
- "Wait, your exam board has SPECIFIC topics?"
- "AI that actually knows YOUR syllabus exists?"

## How to Use

1. Tell me the platform (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, X)
2. Tell me the angle (problem, quiz, comparison, revelation)
3. I'll generate hooks + script + image template

## Image Template Sizes

- TikTok/Reels Story: 1080x1920
- Instagram Post: 1080x1080  
- Twitter/X Post: 1200x675
- LinkedIn: 1200x627

I'll create the HTML, you can screenshot it.
