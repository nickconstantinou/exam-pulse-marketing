# Landing Page Review Request

## Feature Description
ExamPulse landing page - a marketing page for an AI-powered GCSE revision app.

## Current Copy/Landing Page Summary:

**Hero Section:**
- "Stop Cramming. Start Understanding."
- "AI that knows YOUR gaps. Not just any revision — revision that actually moves your grades."
- CTA: "Find My Revision Type" → leads to quiz

**Problem Section:**
- "You've been revising for hours. But your grades? Still the same."
- "Everyone else is wasting time on topics they already know. You're playing guess-what-the-examiner-wants."

**Agitation Section:**
- "ChatGPT is lying to you" - explains AI regularly gives wrong answers
- "Past papers are random, don't adapt"

**Comparison:**
- ChatGPT: ❌ Confident but wrong
- Quizlet: ❌ User-generated, not exam-specific  
- ExamPulse: ✅ Grounded in GCSE specs, adaptive

**Features:**
- Grounded in Exam Specs
- Knows Exam Boards
- Adapts to You
- Answers You Can Trust

**CTA:** Quiz → Waitlist

## Context
- Target audience: GCSE students (14-18)
- Exam boards: UK (AQA, OCR, Edexcel, etc.)
- Key differentiator: AI adapted to exam specs, not generic

## Request
Please review this landing page through the lens of the 12 personas in your advisory board. Focus on:
1. Does it resonate with students?
2. Will they share it?
3. Does it build trust?
4. What age-appropriate concerns might they have?

Also note: We want to lean into "AI but only when grounded in exam specifications" - students choose subject + exam authority.
